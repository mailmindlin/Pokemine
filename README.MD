Pokemine - Adds Pokemon to Minecraft
------------------------------------

-Why Pokemine?

Pokemine is entirely open source, so you can modify it as you want. All of its developers try to document as much of the code as possible,
so you can understand what everything does (yes, even the private methods).
Even if you aren't a modder, Pokemine is just fun to play with. Because it's open source, you know that there isn't a virus
or something in there, and you can retexture at will.
